        "title": "Why TPA?",
        "text": "The TPA token allows holders to participate in an existing and successful inventory financing model managed by TPA Holdings, a publicly-traded distribution company founded in South Korea. All interest revenues generated by the inventory financing model will be automatically distributed as dividends via smart contract to TPA token holders who stake their tokens into the TPA pool. All loans are backed by inventory as collateral and the pool is guaranteed by the Liquidity Reserve smart contract, ensuring holders will never experience withdrawal problems or business interruptions. Prospective investment returns based on TPA Holding’s historical earnings on inventory financing are 16-24%."

      {
        "title": "What happens if a loan defaults?",
        "text": "All loans are backed by the inventory itself as collateral. Historically, a careful vetting process and industry-leading expertise has resulted in a 4% default rate, in which the full loan amounts were ultimately recovered by TPA Holdings.\n\nThe Liquidity Reserve is designed to automate recovery into the loan pool in order to avoid business interruption and potential liquidity problems. When a company defaults on a loan, the Liquidity Reserve will immediately restore the principle to the loan pool and TPA Holdings will restore the Liquidity Reserve after liquidating the collateral. The Liquidity Reserve shall always be equal to or larger than the loan pool, incentivizing TPA Holdings to lock a greater amount of tokens out of circulation into the reserve in order to grow the volume of loans over time."

Investment returns: as the company continues to be profitable and the volume of loans and interest payments increase, more holder will be motivated to purchase TPA tokens and stake them into the pool. Investment returns based on TPA Holding’s historical earnings on inventory financing are 16-24%.\n\n3. Business growth: as TPA Holding’s volume of investments grow over time, more TPA tokens will be required to be locked into the Liquidity Reserve."

TPA Holdings does not take a \"cut\" or fee on these interest payments; they belong to the community.\n\nWhile the publicly traded TPA Holdings will operate the core inventory financing model, the TPA tokens will be issued and held by a non-Korean partner that will enable the tokens to be used within the TPA ecosystem in Korea."
