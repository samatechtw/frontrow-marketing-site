        "text": "The TPA token allows holders to participate in an existing and successful inventory financing model managed by TPA Holdings, a publicly-traded distribution company founded in South Korea. All interest revenues generated by the inventory financing model will be automatically distributed as dividends via smart contract to TPA token holders who stake their tokens into the TPA pool. All loans are backed by inventory as collateral and the pool is guaranteed by the Liquidity Reserve smart contract, ensuring holders will never experience withdrawal problems or business interruptions. Prospective investment returns based on TPA Holding’s historical earnings on inventory financing are 16-24%."
