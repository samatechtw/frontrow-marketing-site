All interest revenues generated by the inventory financing model will be automatically distributed as dividends via smart contract to FRR token holders who stake their tokens into the FRR pool. All loans are backed by inventory as collateral and the pool is guaranteed by the Liquidity Reserve smart contract, ensuring holders will never experience withdrawal problems or business interruptions. Prospective investment returns based on Front Row’s historical earnings on inventory financing are 16-24%."
